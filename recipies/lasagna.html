    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a baked Italian dish, traditionally consisting of layers of wide, flat pasta, a meat or tomato-based sauce (often rag√π), and a creamy cheese mixture (often ricotta and mozzarella), topped with parmesan cheese. It is a hearty casserole, baked until golden brown and bubbly. 
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li> 1 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>
       1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li> 
       1 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li> 2 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>2 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    
</ul>
    
<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
    <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </li>
